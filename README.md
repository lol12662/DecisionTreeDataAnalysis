# DecisionTreeDataAnalysis
Used Python to design a basic data analysis program using decision tree machine learning algorithm

Utilizes pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn

# Installation
First download Jupyter Notebook, a web based IDE using pip
```
pip install notebook

```
You can open by simply typing jupyter notebook into your terminal

```
PS C:\Users\UserName> jupyter notebook

# Files
clean_data (1).csv

A csv/excel file that contains a large amount of data

The program uses several expereiments to train a decision tree classifier in order to predict the outcome using a .7/.3 split between training and testing data
